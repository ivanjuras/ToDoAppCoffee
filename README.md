# CoffeeScript Version of the To-Do app (by Treehouse)

A CoffeeScript version of the To-Do app which has been built in the "Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript" course by Treehouse.

I've changed some minor things (like variable names) in, but otherwise, I followed the course to the T. The only difference is that I was using CoffeeScript all along.
